# Baseten Inference Stability: How Does It Compare?

**An analysis of Baseten's serving stability vs. other inference providers using [VAIL Stability Arena](https://arena.projectvail.com) data.**

*Generated: August 29, 2026*

---

## TL;DR

Baseten serves 9 models in the Stability Arena. Of the three with sufficient monitoring data, Baseten shows **strong stability scores** (avg 0.98–1.00) but **elevated divergence** from the provider consensus on two models, meaning its outputs differ more from other providers serving the same weights. Over 7 months of monitoring, Baseten's stability has **modestly improved** (0.962 → 0.989 monthly avg on GPT-OSS-120B), though divergence remains consistently high.

## Current Stability Scores (as of Aug 29, 2026)

Stability scores range from 0.0 to 1.0, measuring behavioral consistency over a trailing 72-hour window. Above 0.9 = stable. Below 0.75 = significant shift detected.

### GPT-OSS-120B — Provider Comparison

| Provider | Stability Score | Rating |
|----------|:-:|--------|
| Azure | 1.000 | 🟢 Excellent |
| **Baseten** | **0.967** | **🟢 Stable** |

| Nebius | 1.000 | 🟢 Excellent |
| Novita | 0.833 | 🟡 Moderate |
| OpenRouter | 0.975 | 🟢 Stable |
| Parasail | 0.967 | 🟢 Stable |
| Together | 0.663 | 🔴 Unstable |

**Baseten ranks solidly mid-pack on stability** — on par with OpenRouter and Parasail, behind the hyperscalers (Azure, Bedrock) and Fireworks.

### Kimi K3 — Provider Comparison

| Provider | Stability Score | Rating |
|----------|:-:|--------|
| **Baseten** | **1.000** | **🟢 Excellent** |
| DeepInfra | 0.886 | 🟡 Moderate |

| Together | 1.000 | 🟢 Excellent |

**Baseten is top-tier here**, tied with Together for the highest stability score.

### Nemotron Ultra — Provider Comparison

| Provider | Stability Score | Rating |
|----------|:-:|--------|
| **Baseten** | **1.000** | **🟢 Excellent** |
| DeepInfra | 1.000 | 🟢 Excellent |
| Nebius | 0.833 | 🟡 Moderate |

**Baseten ties for best**, matching DeepInfra.

## Divergence: Does Baseten Serve the Same Model?

Divergence ratios measure how much a provider's outputs differ from the consensus of other providers serving the same weights, normalized so that 1.0 = the median consistency across providers of the same model. Less than 1.0 = greater-than-median consistency (more aligned than the typical provider); greater than 1.0 = less-than-median consistency (notably more divergent behavior).

### GPT-OSS-120B — 90-Day Divergence Summary

| Provider | Avg Divergence | Min | Max | Assessment |
|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|------------|
| OpenRouter | 0.46 | -0.33 | 1.76 | ✅ Most consistent |
| Bedrock | 0.75 | 0.04 | 1.95 | ✅ Very consistent |
| Parasail | 0.78 | 0.14 | 1.89 | ✅ Very consistent |
| Azure | 0.79 | 0.09 | 1.47 | ✅ Very consistent |
| Nebius | 0.86 | 0.14 | 1.59 | ✅ Consistent |
| Together | 1.06 | 0.02 | 4.10 | ⚠️ Some drift |
| DeepInfra | 1.35 | 0.46 | 3.64 | ⚠️ Moderate divergence |
| Novita | 1.81 | -0.02 | 3.82 | ⚠️ Notable divergence |
| **Baseten** | **3.58** | **1.84** | **7.16** | **🔴 High divergence** |
| Fireworks | 4.10 | 1.96 | 9.05 | 🔴 Highest divergence |

**Baseten's GPT-OSS-120B outputs diverge significantly from the provider consensus** — second only to Fireworks. This suggests meaningful differences in quantization, system prompts, or inference configuration compared to the majority of providers.

### Nemotron Ultra — 75-Day Divergence Summary

| Provider | Avg Divergence | Min | Max | Assessment |
|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|------------|
| DeepInfra | 0.88 | 0.48 | 1.32 | ✅ Consistent |
| Nebius | 1.45 | 0.51 | 2.78 | ⚠️ Some drift |
| **Baseten** | **3.61** | **0.87** | **9.04** | **🔴 High divergence** |

**Same pattern**: Baseten serves the model stably, but its outputs differ substantially from other providers.

### Kimi K3 — Early Divergence (3 days of data)

| Provider | Avg Divergence | Assessment |
|----------|:-:|------------|
| **Baseten** | **0.32** | **✅ Very consistent** |
| Parasail | 0.42 | ✅ Consistent |
| DeepInfra | 0.73 | ✅ Consistent |
| Together | 1.41 | ⚠️ Some drift |
| Fireworks | 7.65 | 🔴 High divergence |

Early data suggests Baseten's Kimi K3 serving is well-aligned with consensus (though only 3 days of data).

## Has Baseten Improved Over Time?

Monthly stability trend for `gpt-oss-120b-baseten-chat` (7 months of data):

| Month | Avg Stability | Avg Divergence | Trend |
|-------|:-:|:-:|-------|
| Feb 2026 | 0.962 | 3.41 | Baseline |
| Mar 2026 | 0.964 | 2.91 | Divergence improving ↓ |
| Apr 2026 | 0.963 | 2.24 | Best divergence month ↓↓ |
| May 2026 | 0.988 | 3.07 | Stability jump ↑, divergence regressed |
| Jun 2026 | 0.977 | 3.58 | Stable, divergence back up |
| Jul 2026 | 0.978 | 3.64 | Holding steady |
| Aug 2026 | 0.989 | 3.51 | Best stability month ↑ |

**Stability has modestly improved** — from 0.962 in Feb to 0.989 in Aug 2026. However, **divergence has not improved**: after a promising dip to 2.24 in April, it regressed back to 3.5+ where it's remained since June. This suggests Baseten may be using different model configurations (quantization, batching, or custom serving optimizations) that remain stable over time but produce outputs that differ from the broader provider consensus.

### Nemotron Ultra on Baseten (3 months)

| Month | Avg Stability | Avg Divergence |
|-------|:-:|:-:|
| Jun 2026 | 1.000 | 8.20 |
| Jul 2026 | 1.000 | 1.44 |
| Aug 2026 | 0.994 | 3.38 |

Divergence dropped dramatically from June to July (potentially a config fix), but has crept back up.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Baseten's stability is competitive.** Across all models with data, Baseten scores 0.967–1.000, placing it in the "stable" to "excellent" range. It's not the best (hyperscalers like Bedrock consistently hit 1.000), but it's reliably above 0.9.

2. **Baseten's divergence is a concern.** On 2 of 3 models with sufficient data, Baseten's outputs diverge significantly from the provider consensus. This doesn't mean the outputs are wrong — it means they're different from what most other providers produce from the same weights. This could indicate different quantization, custom optimizations, or system-level prompt injection.

3. **Modest improvement over 7 months.** Stability scores have trended up (~3% gain). Divergence showed a promising improvement in spring 2026 but regressed. The R&D investment appears to have paid off for *consistency* (fewer behavioral shifts) but not for *alignment with consensus* (outputs still differ from other providers).

4. **Fireworks has similar divergence issues.** Baseten isn't alone — Fireworks shows even higher divergence on GPT-OSS-120B, suggesting this may be a pattern with providers that apply aggressive serving optimizations.

5. **Too early to judge on most models.** 6 of 9 Baseten endpoints lack sufficient data. As more monitoring data accumulates, the picture will become clearer.

## Methodology

- **Data source:** [VAIL Stability Arena](https://arena.projectvail.com) API
- **Stability scores:** Behavioral consistency measured over a trailing 72-hour window (0.0–1.0 scale). Based on response fingerprinting across standardized evaluation prompts.
- **Divergence ratios:** Daily measure of how much one provider's outputs differ from the consensus of all other providers serving the same model, normalized so that 1.0 = median consistency across providers of the same model. <1.0 = greater than median consistency, >1.0 = less than median consistency (more divergent).
- **Monitoring period:** February 6 – August 29, 2026 (GPT-OSS-120B), June–August 2026 (Nemotron Ultra), August 2026 (Kimi K3).
